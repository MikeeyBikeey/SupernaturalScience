# SupernaturalScience
Supernatural theme jam game made in three days. Created with GameMaker Studio 1.4.

The lives of the supernatural creatures are threatened when Dr. Science sets out to cleanse the world of the unscientific.
You must stop Dr. Science by fighting his supernatural lab rats before your friends are destroyed!

All the 3D in this game is "fake". Everything that seems 3D uses the `draw_sprite_pos` function.
Fake 3D functions can be found in the `F3D` script group. (The math behind the fake 3D is rather simple; I was surprised how well it worked!)
